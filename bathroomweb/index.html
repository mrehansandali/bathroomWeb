            <h1>What Happens During Roseville <br> Bathroom Renovation Services?</h1>
            <p>Our process goes as follows:</p>
        </div>
        <div class="tcfline">
            <div class="tcflitem1 bline">
                <h1>Understanding the Kind of Bathroom the Client Wants</h1>
                <p>This is usually the first step in a bathroom remodeling process. We ask the client whether they want
                    the master bathroom or a guest bedroom remodeled and get to know the details of what they want. In
                    some cases, the clients may want to convert a standard bath into a wet bath. Knowing what you want
                    determines the budget. For instance, master bathrooms and wet baths are generally more expensive
                    than standard bathrooms and guest bedrooms.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="tcflitem2 wline">
                <h1>Understanding the Layout</h1>
                <p>As a building and construction company, we help you make the best of your bathroom space by finding a
                    layout that would work for your space. We make use of as much space as possible by arranging your
                    items and appliances so that it remains beautiful yet functional. It is especially crucial that you
                    properly plan a small bathroom.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="tcflitem3 bline">
                <h1>Flooring</h1>
                <p>The next step in our process is to pick the right flooring for your needs. For instance, hardwood
                    flooring is not an ideal flooring choice for the bathroom. At JC Construction, we recommend that you
                    use vinyl flooring for your bathroom. However, there are other floor choices including ceramic and
                    porcelain tiles, vinyl planks, and sheet vinyl.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="tcsline">
            <div class="tcslitem1 wline">
                <h1>Determining Whether You Need a Bathtub or Shower</h1>
                <p>Different people have different preferences. Whether you prefer a shower or bathtub, our bathroom
                    remodeler can give you an idea of where to start. We help you figure out the type of installation
                    you need. Whether you want a walk-in tub or shower for your elderly family members or you prefer a
                    standard shower, our shower remodel experts have the skills to help you achieve your goals.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="tcslitem2 bline">
                <h1>Ventilation</h1>
                <p>In many cases, a client would forget ventilation or simply overlook it. However, at JC Construction,
                    we understand just how important ventilation is especially during the winter when you cannot open
                    the window and when it is warmer and opening windows would let in the dust.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="tcslitem3 wline">
                <h1>Choosing Materials and Products</h1>
                <p>You must choose the right materials and products for your bathroom remodeling projects. We ensure
                    that we help you choose quality materials that can stand the test of time. We help you strike a fine
                    balance between quality and costs so that you are spending the right amount of money for the right
                    products. Our materials and products come from trusted, honest suppliers. Then, we do a quality job
